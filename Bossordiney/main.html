                Cumdemon is a criminal faction created between 2019 and 2020 by Rezonate with the intent of frying people's brains,
                causing them to have a "zombified" appearance and repeat the word "cumdemon" at all times without any purpose.
            </p>
            <p id="p2" class="section__text">
                But Cumdemon was not known until early 2020, existing only in isolated chat rooms, until the entry of a person who
                began spreading fake news in favor of Cumdemon, trying to turn this faction into a kind of religion, which ended up
                attracting more people and turning them into mental invalids. This person's name is: Bossordiney.

                        Bossordiney is a Brazilian MCPE player known for playing on split and for his dubious skill videos on YouTube.
                        According to him, he is currently living in Saudi Arabia, which has been proven multiple times to be false as he
                        actually lives in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This serves as a demonstration of the missing brain cells in Cumdemon's followers.
                        Bossordiney has been part of the following clans: Spliters, which is made up of other low-skill players, W10Gangz, and Scr0ws,
                        where according to its members, no one ever asked for his entry.

                        Rezonate was an American MCPE player considered by many to be the best in the world in 2017 and 2018.
                        Unlike his other partner, he showcased interesting skills in his videos, such as "Taking out the trash," where he defeated
                        one of the members of Scr0w's and also one of the best Brazilians at the time, Curio, also known as LucqsPvP.
                        Currently, he is a bit more distant from the faction's activities, focusing more on medicine.

                    If you encounter any of these members in a public server, report the player immediately to the staff,
                    playing alongside mentally challenged players like these can be detrimental to your health. If no staff is online,
                    use the email vaitomarnocuboss@gmail.com to report in which server they were spotted and at what time.
